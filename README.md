CORS Configuration
This server is configured to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend running on http://localhost:3000. You can adjust this in the corsHandler setup in the main() function.

Logs
The server logs information about user operations (e.g., users fetched, created, or updated).
Errors are logged to the console for debugging.
Notes
The database file (users.db) is created in the root directory.
The email field must be unique for each user.
Ensure the database file is writable by the server process.
Future Improvements
Add user authentication and authorization.
Implement pagination for the GET /users endpoint.
Enhance validation for input data.
This server is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Next.js frontend provided in the same project.
